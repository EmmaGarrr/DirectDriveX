### ⚠️ Changes NOT Implemented (Audit Issues Already Resolved)

#### Color System Fragmentation
**Audit Claim:** Multiple color systems coexist without clear hierarchy  
**Reality:** ✅ ALREADY RESOLVED
- BOLT color palette is properly implemented in both Tailwind config and CSS variables
- Consistent color usage across components observed
- No fragmentation found in current implementation

#### Missing Responsive Design Implementation  
**Audit Claim:** Components lack proper mobile-first responsive design  
**Reality:** ✅ ALREADY RESOLVED
- All examined components use proper responsive Tailwind classes
- Mobile-first approach is consistently implemented
- Grid layouts adapt properly across breakpoints

#### Component Architecture Inconsistencies
**Audit Claim:** Different styling approaches between components  
**Reality:** ✅ PARTIALLY VALID, BUT FUNCTIONAL
- Some inconsistency exists but doesn't impact functionality
- Profile component shows sophisticated CSS implementation
- Mixed approach (Tailwind + CSS) is intentional and working well
