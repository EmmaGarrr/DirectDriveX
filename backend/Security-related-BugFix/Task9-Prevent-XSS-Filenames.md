# Task 9: Prevent XSS in Filenames - Implementation History

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### What Existed Before Changes

**Filename Handling Architecture (EXISTING):**
- **File Models**: `FileMetadataBase`, `FileMetadataCreate`, `FileMetadataInDB` in `backend/app/models/file.py`
- **API Endpoints**: Upload, download, admin file listing, batch upload all returned filename data directly
- **Current Security**: Basic filename validation existed but no XSS protection
- **Response Patterns**: Filenames returned directly in API responses without HTML escaping

**Existing Validation Flow (Before Task 9):**
```
User Upload → Filename Stored → API Response → Frontend Display
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  Basic Validation → Database → Direct Return → Potential XSS
```

**Missing Layer:** XSS prevention between filename storage and frontend display

**Current Security Measures:**
- Basic filename validation (length, dangerous characters)
- Path traversal prevention
- File type validation
- **Missing:** HTML/JavaScript escaping for display

### Existing API Response Patterns

**Upload Routes (`routes_upload.py`):**
```python
# VULNERABLE - Direct filename return
return {"file_id": file_id, "gdrive_upload_url": gdrive_upload_url}
```

**Admin File Listing (`routes_admin_files.py`):**
```python
# VULNERABLE - Direct filename return in file objects
file_doc["filename"] = file_doc.get("filename", "")
return FileListResponse(files=files, ...)
```

**Batch Upload (`routes_batch_upload.py`):**
```python
# VULNERABLE - Direct filename return
return InitiateBatchResponse(
    batch_id=batch_id,
    files=file_upload_info_list  # Contains raw filenames
)
```

**Download Routes (`routes_download.py`):**
```python
# VULNERABLE - Direct filename return in metadata
return file_doc  # Contains raw filename
```

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

### Security Vulnerability: XSS Through Filename Display

**Issue #9:** Filenames containing HTML/JavaScript code could execute in user browsers when displayed, creating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Attack Scenarios Possible:**
```python
# DANGEROUS - These filenames could execute JavaScript in browsers:
dangerous_filenames = [
    "document<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>.pdf",
    "file<img src=x onerror=alert('Hacked!')>.txt",
    "data<svg onload=alert('Malicious Code')></svg>.csv",
    "report<iframe src='javascript:alert(\"XSS\")'></iframe>.xlsx",
    "invoice<script>fetch('/steal-data?token='+localStorage.token)</script>.pdf"
]
```

**Attack Scenarios to Prevent:**
1. **Session Hijacking**: Filenames containing code to steal user authentication tokens
2. **Malicious Redirects**: Code to redirect users to phishing sites
3. **Data Theft**: JavaScript to extract sensitive information from the page
4. **UI Manipulation**: Code to modify page appearance or create fake forms
5. **Cross-Site Request Forgery**: Code to perform unauthorized actions

**Security Risks:**
1. **No HTML Escaping**: Filenames displayed directly without escaping dangerous characters
2. **JavaScript Execution**: Malicious code in filenames could execute in user browsers
3. **Session Compromise**: Attackers could steal authentication tokens through XSS
4. **Data Breach**: Sensitive information could be extracted through malicious filenames
5. **User Trust Exploitation**: Attackers could manipulate the UI to deceive users

**Risk Assessment:** LOW RISK - XSS vulnerability through filename display affecting user interface security

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Multi-Layer XSS Prevention Architecture

**New Security Flow (After Task 9):**
```
User Upload → Filename Stored → XSS Sanitization → API Response → Safe Frontend Display
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  Basic Validation → Database → HTML Escaping → Safe Filename → No XSS Execution
```

### 1. Filename Sanitization Functions Created

**File:** `backend/app/models/file.py`

```python
import html

def sanitize_filename_for_display(filename: str) -> str:
    """
    Sanitize filename for safe HTML display by escaping dangerous characters.
    
    This function converts potentially dangerous HTML/JavaScript characters into
    safe HTML entities that browsers will display as text instead of executing.
    
    Args:
        filename: Original filename that may contain HTML/JavaScript
        
    Returns:
        str: Safe filename with HTML characters escaped for display
        
    Examples:
        >>> sanitize_filename_for_display("doc<script>alert('xss')</script>.pdf")
        "doc&lt;script&gt;alert(&#x27;xss&#x27;)&lt;/script&gt;.pdf"
        
        >>> sanitize_filename_for_display("image<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.jpg")
        "image&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;.jpg"
    """
    if not filename:
        return ""
    
    # Use Python's built-in html.escape() for comprehensive HTML escaping
    # quote=True ensures both single and double quotes are escaped
    safe_filename = html.escape(filename, quote=True)
    
    return safe_filename

def sanitize_filename_for_display_optional(filename: Optional[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Sanitize optional filename for safe HTML display.
    
    Args:
        filename: Optional filename that may be None
        
    Returns:
        Optional[str]: Safe filename or None if input was None
    """
    if filename is None:
        return None
    return sanitize_filename_for_display(filename)
```

**HTML Escaping Coverage:**
- `<` → `&lt;` (less than)
- `>` → `&gt;` (greater than)
- `'` → `&#x27;` (single quote)
- `"` → `&quot;` (double quote)
- `&` → `&amp;` (ampersand)

### 2. File Model Safe Display Properties Added

**File:** `backend/app/models/file.py`

```python
class FileMetadataBase(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    original_filename: Optional[str] = None
    
    # ... ALL EXISTING FIELDS REMAIN UNCHANGED ...
    
    # NEW: XSS-SAFE DISPLAY PROPERTIES
    @property
    def safe_filename_for_display(self) -> str:
        """Get filename safely escaped for HTML display"""
        return sanitize_filename_for_display(self.filename)
    
    @property 
    def safe_original_filename_for_display(self) -> Optional[str]:
        """Get original filename safely escaped for HTML display"""
        return sanitize_filename_for_display_optional(self.original_filename)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Automatic Safety**: All filename displays automatically use safe versions
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing code continues working unchanged
- **Consistent Protection**: All file models get XSS protection automatically

### 3. API Response Updates for XSS Protection

**Upload Routes (`backend/app/api/v1/routes_upload.py`):**

```python
# BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
return {"file_id": file_id, "gdrive_upload_url": gdrive_upload_url}

# AFTER (XSS-SAFE):
return {
    "file_id": file_id, 
    "gdrive_upload_url": gdrive_upload_url, 
    "filename": request.filename,  # Original for file operations
    "safe_filename_for_display": sanitize_filename_for_display(request.filename)  # Safe for display
}
```

**Cancel Upload Response:**
```python
# BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
return {
    "message": "Upload cancelled successfully", 
    "file_id": file_id,
    "filename": file_doc.get("filename"),
    "cancelled_at": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
}

# AFTER (XSS-SAFE):
return {
    "message": "Upload cancelled successfully", 
    "file_id": file_id,
    "filename": file_doc.get("filename"),  # Original
    "safe_filename_for_display": sanitize_filename_for_display(file_doc.get("filename", "")),  # Safe
    "cancelled_at": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
}
```

**Admin File Listing (`backend/app/api/v1/routes_admin_files.py`):**

```python
# BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
# Enrich files with additional data
for file_doc in files:
    # ... existing enrichment ...
    file_doc["download_url"] = f"/api/v1/download/stream/{file_doc['_id']}"

# AFTER (XSS-SAFE):
# Enrich files with additional data
for file_doc in files:
    # ... existing enrichment ...
    
    # --- NEW: XSS PROTECTION - Add safe display filenames ---
    file_doc["safe_filename_for_display"] = sanitize_filename_for_display(file_doc.get("filename", ""))
    if file_doc.get("original_filename"):
        file_doc["safe_original_filename_for_display"] = sanitize_filename_for_display(file_doc.get("original_filename"))
    
    # ... existing enrichment ...
    file_doc["download_url"] = f"/api/v1/download/stream/{file_doc['_id']}"
```

**Batch Upload Response (`backend/app/models/batch.py`):**

```python
# BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
class FileUploadInfo(BaseModel):
    file_id: str
    gdrive_upload_url: str
    original_filename: str

# AFTER (XSS-SAFE):
class FileUploadInfo(BaseModel):
    file_id: str
    gdrive_upload_url: str
    original_filename: str
    # --- NEW: XSS PROTECTION - Safe display filename ---
    safe_filename_for_display: str
```

**Batch Upload Route (`backend/app/api/v1/routes_batch_upload.py`):**

```python
# BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
file_upload_info_list.append(
    InitiateBatchResponse.FileUploadInfo(
        file_id=file_id,
        gdrive_upload_url=gdrive_upload_url,
        original_filename=file_info.filename
    )
)

# AFTER (XSS-SAFE):
file_upload_info_list.append(
    InitiateBatchResponse.FileUploadInfo(
        file_id=file_id,
        gdrive_upload_url=gdrive_upload_url,
        original_filename=file_info.filename,  # Original
        safe_filename_for_display=sanitize_filename_for_display(file_info.filename)  # Safe
    )
)
```
