## Migration Steps for Existing Developers

### Step 1: Backup Your Current Configuration
Your current environment files are still available locally. You can reference them for the migration.

### Step 2: Copy Template Files
```bash
cp src/environments/environment.template.ts src/environments/environment.ts
cp src/environments/environment.prod.template.ts src/environments/environment.prod.ts
```

### Step 3: Update with Your Current Values
Copy your current configuration values from the backup files to the new template-based files.

### Step 4: Test Your Setup
```bash
npm start
```
Verify that your application works correctly with the new configuration.
