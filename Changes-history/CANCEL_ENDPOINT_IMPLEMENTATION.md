# Cancel Upload Endpoints Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented proper HTTP cancel endpoints for both single file uploads and batch uploads, replacing the previous WebSocket-only cancellation method.

## New Endpoints Added

### 1. Single File Upload Cancellation
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/upload/cancel/{file_id}`

**Features**:
- Validates file exists and is in cancellable state (PENDING or UPLOADING)
- Updates file status to "cancelled" with timestamp and cancellation source
- Provides detailed response with cancellation details
- Logs cancellation for monitoring purposes

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "message": "Upload cancelled successfully",
  "file_id": "uuid-here",
  "filename": "example.pdf",
  "cancelled_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Batch Upload Cancellation
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/batch/cancel/{batch_id}`

**Features**:
- Cancels entire batch and all associated files
- Updates all file statuses to "cancelled"
- Updates batch status to "cancelled"
- Returns cancellation summary with counts

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "message": "Batch upload cancelled successfully",
  "batch_id": "batch-uuid",
  "cancelled_files_count": 5,
  "total_files_in_batch": 5,
  "cancelled_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Model Updates

### 1. UploadStatus Enum
Added new status: `CANCELLED = "cancelled"`

### 2. BatchStatus Enum
New enum with statuses:
- `PENDING = "pending"`
- `PROCESSING = "processing"`
- `COMPLETED = "completed"`
- `FAILED = "failed"`
- `CANCELLED = "cancelled"`

### 3. BatchMetadata Model
Added fields:
- `status: BatchStatus = BatchStatus.PENDING`
- `cancelled_at: Optional[datetime] = None`
- `cancelled_files_count: Optional[int] = None`

## Implementation Details

### Error Handling
- **404**: File/Batch not found
- **400**: File/Batch not in cancellable state
- **500**: Database update failure

### Database Updates
- File status changed to "cancelled"
- Timestamp recorded (`cancelled_at`)
- Cancellation source tracked (`cancelled_by`)

### Logging
- Structured logging for monitoring
- Clear identification of cancelled files/batches
- Audit trail for cancellation actions

## Benefits

1. **Faster Response**: HTTP endpoints respond faster than WebSocket operations
2. **Better Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Separation of concerns between upload and cancellation
4. **Monitoring**: Better tracking of cancellation patterns
5. **Fallback Support**: Frontend can still use WebSocket closure as backup

## Frontend Integration

The frontend can now:
1. **Primary Method**: Use HTTP cancel endpoints for fast, reliable cancellation
2. **Fallback Method**: Still use WebSocket closure if HTTP fails
3. **Better UX**: Show immediate feedback and proper loading states
4. **Error Handling**: Handle cancellation failures gracefully

## Testing

All new endpoints have been tested for:
- ✅ Route registration
- ✅ Import compatibility
- ✅ Model validation
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Backward Compatibility

- **No breaking changes** to existing upload functionality
- **WebSocket cancellation** still works as fallback
- **Existing file statuses** remain unchanged
- **Database schema** extended without modification of existing fields

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Updates**: Update frontend to use new HTTP endpoints
2. **Testing**: Test cancellation with real uploads
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor cancellation patterns and success rates
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to include new endpoints
