# Task 7: File Size Input Validation - Implementation History

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### What Existed Before Changes

**Business Logic Limits (EXISTING):**
- Anonymous users: 2GB daily limit, 2GB single file limit  
- Authenticated users: 5GB daily limit, 5GB single file limit
- Implemented in `app.services.upload_limits_service.py`
- Environment-based enable/disable controls
- Proper quota tracking and caching

**Frontend Validation (EXISTING):**
- File size validation in Angular components
- User-type based limit checking (2GB/5GB)
- Batch upload size validation
- Clear error messages to users

**Backend Integration (EXISTING):**
- Business logic limits enforced in upload routes
- Upload limits service integration
- Proper error handling for quota exceeded

**Critical Security Gap Identified:**
```python
# VULNERABLE CODE - No input validation:
class InitiateUploadRequest(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    size: int  # ❌ NO VALIDATION - accepts any integer
    content_type: str

class FileInfo(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    size: int  # ❌ NO VALIDATION - accepts any integer  
    content_type: str
```

### Existing Validation Flow (Before Task 7)
```
Frontend → Business Logic → Upload Processing
    ↓           ↓              ↓
User Input → Quota Check → File Storage
```

**Missing Layer:** Input validation security between user input and business logic

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

### Security Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation

**Issue #7:** No file size input validation allows malicious data to bypass security checks

**Attack Scenarios Possible:**
```python
# These malicious inputs were ACCEPTED before Task 7:
{"filename": "hack.txt", "size": -500000, "content_type": "text/plain"}     # Negative
{"filename": "empty.txt", "size": 0, "content_type": "text/plain"}          # Zero  
{"filename": "huge.txt", "size": 999999999999999, "content_type": "text/plain"} # Overflow
```

**Security Risks:**
1. **Negative File Sizes:** Could cause arithmetic underflow in calculations
2. **Zero File Sizes:** Wasteful resource allocation and processing
3. **Impossibly Large Numbers:** Integer overflow, memory exhaustion attacks
4. **Invalid Data Types:** Potential for system instability
5. **No Overflow Protection:** Risk of system crashes

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM RISK - Input validation vulnerability affecting data integrity and system stability

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Multi-Layer Security Architecture

**New Validation Flow (After Task 7):**
```
Frontend → Input Validation → Business Logic → Upload Processing
    ↓           ↓                ↓              ↓
User Input → Safety Check → Quota Check → File Storage
```

### 1. Security Constants Added

**File:** `backend/app/core/config.py`

```python
# --- NEW: SECURITY INPUT VALIDATION CONSTANTS ---
# These are separate from business logic limits and provide input safety validation
# Input validation prevents malicious/invalid data before business rules are applied
MAX_FILE_SIZE_INPUT_VALIDATION: int = 10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 10GB absolute maximum for input validation
MIN_FILE_SIZE_INPUT_VALIDATION: int = 1  # 1 byte minimum for input validation
MAX_FILE_SIZE_INPUT_VALIDATION_GB: int = 10  # 10GB in GB units for error messages
```

**Design Decision:** 10GB input validation limit is higher than business logic limits (2GB/5GB) to ensure input validation doesn't interfere with business rules.

### 2. Enhanced Pydantic Models

**File:** `backend/app/models/file.py`

```python
class InitiateUploadRequest(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    size: int = Field(
        ..., 
        gt=0,  # Must be greater than 0
        le=10*1024*1024*1024,  # Must be less than or equal to 10GB
        description="File size in bytes (1B to 10GB maximum)"
    )
    content_type: str
    
    @validator('size')
    def validate_file_size(cls, v):
        """
        Validate file size for security input validation
        This is separate from business logic limits (2GB/5GB) and provides input safety
        """
        if v <= 0:
            raise ValueError('File size must be greater than 0 bytes')
        if v > 10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024:  # 10GB
            raise ValueError('File size exceeds maximum allowed limit of 10GB')
        return v
```

**File:** `backend/app/models/batch.py`

```python
class FileInfo(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    original_filename: Optional[str] = None
    size: int = Field(
        ..., 
        gt=0,  # Must be greater than 0
        le=10*1024*1024*1024,  # Must be less than or equal to 10GB
        description="File size in bytes (1B to 10GB maximum)"
    )
    content_type: str
    
    @validator('size')
    def validate_file_size(cls, v):
        """
        Validate file size for security input validation
        This is separate from business logic limits (2GB/5GB) and provides input safety
        """
        if v <= 0:
            raise ValueError('File size must be greater than 0 bytes')
        if v > 10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024:  # 10GB
            raise ValueError('File size exceeds maximum allowed limit of 10GB')
        return v
```

### 3. Overflow Protection Functions

**File:** `backend/app/api/v1/routes_upload.py` & `backend/app/api/v1/routes_batch_upload.py`

```python
# --- SECURITY: File size input validation functions ---
def safe_size_validation(size: int) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Safely validate file size with overflow protection and input safety checks
    
    Args:
        size: File size value to validate
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (is_valid: bool, error_message: str)
    """
    try:
        # Check if size is an integer
        if not isinstance(size, int):
            return False, "File size must be a valid integer"
        
        # Check for negative values
        if size <= 0:
            return False, "Invalid file size: File size must be greater than 0 bytes"
        
        # Check against maximum input validation limit (10GB)
        max_size = settings.MAX_FILE_SIZE_INPUT_VALIDATION
        if size > max_size:
            max_size_gb = settings.MAX_FILE_SIZE_INPUT_VALIDATION_GB
            return False, f"Invalid file size: File size exceeds maximum allowed limit of {max_size_gb}GB"
        
        return True, "File size is valid"
        
    except (OverflowError, ValueError, TypeError) as e:
        return False, f"Invalid file size: Please provide a valid file size ({str(e)})"

def validate_file_size_input(size: int) -> None:
    """
    Validate file size input and raise HTTPException if invalid
    
    Args:
        size: File size to validate
    
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If file size is invalid
    """
    is_valid, error_message = safe_size_validation(size)
    if not is_valid:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=error_message)
```

### 4. Route Integration

**Single File Upload Route (`backend/app/api/v1/routes_upload.py`):**

```python
async def initiate_upload(request: InitiateUploadRequest, ...):
    # --- SECURITY: Input validation layer (BEFORE business logic) ---
    # This validates that the input data is safe and valid, separate from business rules
    validate_file_size_input(request.size)
    
    # --- SECURITY: Validate file safety BEFORE processing ---
    is_safe, safety_error = validate_file_safety(request.filename, request.content_type)
    if not is_safe:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=safety_error)
    
    # EXISTING: Business logic validation continues unchanged
    # (2GB anonymous, 5GB authenticated limits remain as-is)
```

**Batch File Upload Route (`backend/app/api/v1/routes_batch_upload.py`):**

```python
async def initiate_batch_upload(request: InitiateBatchRequest, ...):
    # --- SECURITY: Input validation layer (BEFORE business logic) ---
    # Validate all file sizes in batch for input safety
    for i, file_info in enumerate(request.files):
        try:
            validate_file_size_input(file_info.size)
        except HTTPException as e:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=400,
                detail=f"File {i+1} ('{file_info.filename}'): {e.detail}"
            )
    
    # EXISTING: File safety and business logic validation continues unchanged
```

### 5. Error Messages Implemented

**Clear, Specific Error Messages:**
- `"Invalid file size: File size must be greater than 0 bytes"`
- `"Invalid file size: File size exceeds maximum allowed limit of 10GB"`
- `"File size must be a valid integer"`
- `"File {i+1} ('{filename}'): {error_detail}"` (for batch uploads)

## VERIFICATION COMPLETE

### ✅ SECURITY VULNERABILITY ELIMINATED

**Before Implementation:**
```python
# VULNERABLE - Any file size value accepted
{"filename": "test.txt", "size": -999999, "content_type": "text/plain"}  # ❌ ACCEPTED
{"filename": "test.txt", "size": 0, "content_type": "text/plain"}         # ❌ ACCEPTED  
{"filename": "test.txt", "size": 999999999999999, "content_type": "text/plain"} # ❌ ACCEPTED
```

**After Implementation:**
```python
# SECURE - Invalid file sizes properly rejected
{"filename": "test.txt", "size": -999999, "content_type": "text/plain"}  # ✅ REJECTED
{"filename": "test.txt", "size": 0, "content_type": "text/plain"}         # ✅ REJECTED
{"filename": "test.txt", "size": 999999999999999, "content_type": "text/plain"} # ✅ REJECTED
```
