Before doing any code analysis or proposing fixes, ALWAYS CALL the MCP tool named "error_lookup" with this payload:

{
  "project_id": "your-actual-project-name",
  "error_text": "<paste the error line(s)>",
  "stack_trace": "<paste stack trace>",
  "top_k": 5
}

Use the returned top matches (if any) as explicit evidence in your reasoning and include them verbatim when proposing a fix. Do not proceed until the lookup returns results or confirms no match.
