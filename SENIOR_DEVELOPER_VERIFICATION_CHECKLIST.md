# SENIOR DEVELOVER VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

## Overview
Use this checklist to verify that the senior audit developer has completed the implementation perfectly. Each item MUST be checked and confirmed.

## Pre-Implementation Verification

### Backup Created ✅ 
- [x] Created backup directory: `backup_fix_400_error`
- [x] Backed up `upload_concurrency_manager.py`
- [x] Backed up `main.py`
- [x] Verified backup files are intact

### Issue Confirmed ✅ 
- [x] Ran `python exception_capture_test.py`
- [x] Confirmed "Original function result: False"
- [x] Confirmed "Debug function result: True"
- [x] Issue exists as expected

## Implementation Verification

### File 1: upload_concurrency_manager.py ✅

#### Exception Masking Fixed (Lines 171-200)
- [x] Replaced `except Exception as e:` block with proper exception re-raising
- [x] Added proper exception re-raising with `raise`
- [x] Added detailed error logging with user/file context
- [x] Added semaphore release error handling with try-catch
- [x] Added cleanup status tracking (global_released, user_released)

#### Memory Calculation Bug Fixed (Lines 133-136)

#### Error Handling Improved (Lines 650-661)
- [x] Wrapped `acquire_upload_slot` call in try-catch block
- [x] Added specific exception handling with detailed logging
- [x] Improved error messages in WebSocket close reasons
- [x] Added proper error codes (1008, 1011) for different failure types
